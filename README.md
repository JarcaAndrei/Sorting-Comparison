# Sorting-Comparison - made in Python

- School project where our task was to analyze some sorting algorithms and compare their running times on different tests
- The sorting algorithms are Radix, Bubble, Quick, Merge, Count sort and the default sort in python
- The test options are based on an almost sorted (both ascending and descending) and random array
- The project takes the time for multiple data times such as int, string, char and double, on various array sizes and maximum numbers
